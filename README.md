# SOC Analyst Portfolio — Alexir Cybersec

Public portfolio documenting my transition into a **SOC Analyst** role.
Focus: **SOC-style investigations (ticket write-ups)**, **playbooks**, **query/snippet bank**, and a **capstone case study**.

**SOC workflow shown here:**
alert → triage → evidence → pivots → verdict → actions → escalation → detection improvement.
