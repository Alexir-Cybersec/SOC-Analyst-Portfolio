# SOC Analyst Portfolio — Alexir Cybersec

Public portfolio documenting my transition into a **SOC Analyst** role.
Focus: **SOC-style investigations**, **playbooks**, **query/snippet bank**, and one **capstone case study**.

**Goal:** demonstrate job-relevant SOC workflow:
alert → triage → evidence → pivots → verdict → actions → escalation → detection improvement.
