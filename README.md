# SOC Analyst Portfolio — Alexir Cybersec

A practical, **SOC-style** portfolio built from hands-on labs, investigations, and detection work as I transition into blue team security.

> **Repo focus:** evidence of skills (write-ups, playbooks, query packs, reporting), not just course completion.

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Write-ups**: investigation narratives (phishing, web attacks, SIEM triage, endpoint leads)
  → `writeups/`
- **Playbooks**: repeatable workflows (triage, escalation, enrichment, reporting)
  → `playbooks/`
- **Detection / Query packs**: **SPL + KQL** snippet libraries + explanation notes
  → `snippets/`
- **Capstone-style reports**: longer, end-to-end investigations
  → `capstone/`
- **Images**: supporting visuals used by write-ups
  → `images/`

## Portfolio releases (versions)

I track this portfolio in **public releases** so we can quickly compare progress.

- **v1.0 — Portfolio Ready (15 Feb 2026)**
  Baseline SOC artifacts: initial investigations + first playbooks + early query packs.
- **v2.0 — Extended Portfolio (29 Mar 2026)**
  Expanded investigations + additional playbooks + stronger SIEM content + Microsoft SOC tooling artifacts.

> Tip: check the **Releases** tab to view each portfolio snapshot (v1 vs v2).

## Current learning journey

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Jan → early Feb 2026)

- **TryHackMe: Cyber Security 101**
- **TryHackMe: SOC Level 1** (completed by **7 Feb**)

### Phase 2 — SOC Reps + SIEM Skills (Feb → mid Mar 2026)

- **LetsDefend: SOC Analyst Learning Path**
- **LetsDefend: SIEM Engineer Path**
  (planned to complete within the Feb → mid-March window)

### Phase 3 — Microsoft SOC Tooling (from mid Mar 2026)

- **SC-200 (Microsoft Learn)** — Microsoft Sentinel + Defender XDR focus
  _This phase continues beyond v2._

### Future Plan

This may vary, depends on trends and work opportunity.

- THM SOC Level 2 → TCM SOC 201 → CyberDefenders CCD → HTB CDSA → AZ-500

## How I keep artifacts safe

This repo is **sanitized**:

- No employer data, internal tooling screenshots, real client info, or sensitive identifiers
- No platform answer dumps or paid-content copying
- IPs/usernames/hostnames are generalized where needed
- Focus is on **reasoning + workflow**, not “spoilers”
